# Turtle-Pong
Testing the Turtle Python module with a 2 player remake of Pong.

This is a remake of Pong using the Turtle module with Python. There are some small changes from the original game, such as the ball being 
replaced with a turtle, and the speed of the ball slightly changing at random to make the game more challenging. It is a two player game 
that utilizes the up and down arrow keys, as well as the w and s keys for player controls. The game will keep track of both scores and
display them at the top of the screen. I have also created a couple of sound effects for when a player scores or collides with something.
